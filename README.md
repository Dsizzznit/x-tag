# X-Tag - Custom Elements for Modern Browsers


Based on the current W3 Web Components [draft][1], X-Tag enables the custom element portion of the proposal.
Custom elements let you register new tags/elements with the parser so they are recognized and inflated with
special abilities you define.

Find out more about what X-Tag does, where it works, and how to use it, on the project page here: http://mozilla.github.com/x-tag/
